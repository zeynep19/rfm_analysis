# rfm_analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a very simple technique that we can apply it very easy and get the super useful analysis for our Customer Segmentation. 
RFM enables customers to "divide into groups based on their purchasing habits" and develop strategies specific to these groups.
RFM considers recency, frequency and monetary values for each customer. 
Combines them, and then groups them into different customer segments for easy recall and campaign targeting. 
Itâ€™s super useful in understanding responsiveness of your customers and for segmentation driven database marketing.
